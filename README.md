# MAL to Osu!

## Description

MAL to Osu! is a web application that takes a MyAnimeList (MAL) username as input and returns a list of songs from the popular game Osu! that appear on the user's anime list. The app has utilized the Osu! API, unofficial MyAnimeList API, and Beautiful Soup for data gathering. This website uses regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and Jinja to display the content. The back end uses Flask with an SQLite3 database for faster processing and the full website is hosted on Heroku.
