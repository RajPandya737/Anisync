# MAL to Osu!

## Description

MAL to Osu! is a web application that takes a MyAnimeList (MAL) username as input and returns a list of songs from the popular game Osu! that appear on the user's anime list. The app previously utilizes the Osu! API, unofficial MyAnimeList API, and Beautiful Soup for web scraping, however. This website will be using regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end with the use of Jinja. The back end will be using Flask and Python with an SQLite3 database for faster processing. The website will be hosted on Heroku.
